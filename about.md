            Story Begins like this- Like everyone, we have our unique story which started 6years back when I started realizing the wrong things happening with the environment and the day when I saw a cow eating plastic and I couldn't help it. It was then that I decided to work for mother nature and to begin with one of its most important components - The COW. And then we had a new family member - "Bahula" - Haryanvi Breed of DESI Cows and later on the family grew.
        </p>
        <p>
            After 4 years with our cows at my place and with a better understanding of their needs and requirements, we decided to take a step further. I started with Natural farming and then finally we came up with a Gausadan(A home for cows) called Prakriti Nutan Vann.
